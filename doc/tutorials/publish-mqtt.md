# publish-mqtt

After compilation the tool `raduino-mqtt-client`

```console
raduino-mqtt-client
           -K <key> : encrypt command with transport key
       -N <address> : wakeup node address
       -n <address> : gateway address
                 -h : p rint this text
```

this tool will connect to `localhost:1883`. In future versions this will hopefully be configurable
