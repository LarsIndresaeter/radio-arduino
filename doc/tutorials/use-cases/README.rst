use cases
=========

The primary use case for the code in this project is the `gateway-and-node.rst` case but other cases are also supported.

* arduino-nano-ina219-power-monitor.rst : read voltage and current and report min, max and average per second
* nrf24l01-sniffer.rst : configure the nrf24l01 chip to be in an undocumented verbose mode and send data to the serial port
* quadrature-encoder.rst : read quadrature encoder using the RaduinoCommandQuadratureEncoder command
* rs232-radio-bridge.rst : configure two gateways to bridge data from rs232 to to the serial port. One device is the sender but communication is two-way
