nrf24l01 verbose mode
=====================

to set the nrf24l01 in verbose mode run the command:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./bin/raduino-device-nrf24l-1 -v

This will only work for the gateway. After setting the device in verbose mode data will be sent directly to the serial port and no commands will be parsed.
