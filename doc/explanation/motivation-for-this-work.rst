motivation
==========

This repository is the result of several learning projects which has influenced the outcome. I have used this to learn:

* conan
* cmake
* modern C++
* custom binary protocol with support for encrypted payloads
* OpenSSl 3.1
* Radio communication using the nrf24l01
* mqtt
* and finally, writing better documentation

The most difficult part is possibly the documentation!
