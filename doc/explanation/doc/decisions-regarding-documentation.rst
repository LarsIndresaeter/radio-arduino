documentation
=============

TODO: expand this

rst instead of markdown
-----------------------

this might change but for now restructured text (rst) is seletected becaure of the features of the language such as:

* better support for tables

README.rst in each folder
-------------------------

This allows for a more natural rendering on github.com

links in the docs
-----------------

The docs are optimized for display on github.com, not your editor.
